# Face Detection Server based on Django
This is a perfect demo for those who want to use a cloud face detect service.  

Thanks to these two guys great works before:  
[Adrian  Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/11/creating-a-face-detection-api-with-python-and-opencv-in-just-5-minutes/)

[Zhou](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/36939727)  

Some of there APIs may not works any more. So this kind of 'cv_tip' is a an updated version. Simply tested on Python 3.6 and OpenCV 3.4.  

By using this repo you can easily get a cloud face detect operation, enjoy :P

### If you want, it also can be changed into a tensorflow service regardless of its performance, really fun :p
